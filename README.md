## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Node.js and npm (latest LTS version)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thg-muc/tip-genius.git
    cd tip-genius
    ```

2. Set up Python environment (using conda):

    ```bash
    conda env create -f conda.yaml
    conda activate tip-genius
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure environment variables:

    Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

    ```bash
    ODDS_API_KEY=your_odds_api_key
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
    MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key
    DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
    KV_REST_API_TOKEN=your_vercel_kv_token
    KV_REST_API_URL=your_vercel_kv_url
    ```

    In case you make a deployment later, these variables should be added to Github Secrets.

### Running Locally

1. Start the development server from the project root:

    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```

2. Open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser

## Deployment

The project is automatically deployed to Vercel when changes are pushed to the main branch. Manual deployments can be triggered using:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```
